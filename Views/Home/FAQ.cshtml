                <strong>Environmental Weeds</strong>
                <p>
                    Environmental weeds are non-indigenous (not locally native) plants that
                    impact on indigenous vegetation by competing for space, nutrients, water, light and pollinators.
                    They are plants that invade native ecosystems and have the potential to adversely affect the survival
                    of native flora or fauna or the functioning of ecosystems.
                </p>
                <strong>Casual or Ruderal Species</strong>
                <p>
                    ‘Casual or ruderal’ species can grow and occasionally successfully reproduce in this new geographic
                    context but cannot, or have not, yet established long-term self-sustaining populations.
                </p>
                <strong>Previously Naturalized</strong>
                <p>
                    ‘Naturalised’ plants are those species that have established long-term self-
                    sustaining populations in their new geographic context. A significant proportion of the naturalised
                    flora have subsequently become environmental weeds. These are species that have demonstrated a
                    capacity to invade native ecosystems and are the species that have been ranked in the list for
                    conservation management purposes.

                classification of the environment using a range of attributes such as climate, geomorphology,
                geology, soils and vegetation. The advisory list recognises five weed biomes: Coasts and Heathlands,
